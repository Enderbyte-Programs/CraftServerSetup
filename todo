# Todo List

## Planned Updates

### 1.55

- Telemetry overhaul
    - Four levels
    - Nothing
    - Basic Information (software version, os version)
    - Crash reports (send crash reports)
    - Detailed information (installation type, number of servers, computer memory amount)
- Probably have some "telemetry key" to track crashes
- This will require significant backend web programming
- Also minor feature, allow the user to launch a shell from java or bedrock server management (bash on Linux, cmd on windows)

### 1.56

- Disk space analyser
- basic mode - just see plugins %, world%, all customized. Delete option works on all
- Advanced mode - shows each folder without customization. Delete option for specific files or specific subdirectories
- For each, it will be a bar chart using a unique character for each subfolder. 
- Possibly summary view as well which is more visual

### 1.57

- Versioning reform
- Customized settings screen for each version of Minecraft
- Sort releases/snapshots/experiments when doing version listings

### Far future / unplanned

- Add bungeecord and Velocity support
- Add fabric and/or forge support
- Add inventory viewer or player data editor
