# automcserver
##The best way to set up a Minecraft server on Linux

##Setup and Installation

STEP 1: Download install.sh from the repository. This program will take care of all installation. You may download the .py file only if you wish.

STEP 2: Open a terminal to the location of install.sh and run `bash install.sh -h`. If the file has RWX permissions, you may run `./install.sh -h` if you like. WARNING: this only works if /usr/bin/sh -> /usr/bin/bash

STEP 3: Choose the installation plan for you: Install for everyone (sudo bash install.sh) or only for you (bash install.sh -l). You may also remove an existing installation with bash install.sh -r. By default, the python file is grabbed from Enderbyte Programs servers. BUT, if you wish to install a custom build, put automcserver.py in the same directory as install.sh.

STEP 4: Run automcserver to make sure it worked.
