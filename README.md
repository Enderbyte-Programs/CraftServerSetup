# Craft Server Setup
## The best way to set up a Minecraft Server on your computer

## Setup and Installation

## WINDOWS

The Windows edition uses an installer. Follow the steps in the installer. All dependencies are included.

You may have to dismiss warnings of uncommon programs or even malware from Windows. Please dismiss them as they are false alarms. If this program contains a virus that I have willingly included, you may sue me for a million dollars.

## Linux

### Installing from tar.xz

- Download craftserversetup.tar.xz from the latest release

- Unzip the tar.xz to a directory

- Open a terminal in that directory

- Run the command `./installer`

- This will install it locally. To install it for everyone, run `sudo ./installer`

- To remove it, run `./installer uninstall`

- If for some reason the installer is not chmodded, run `python3 installer`

### Building from source

- Clone the repository with `git clone <url>`

- Install sbuild-dofile from https://github.com/Enderbyte-Programs/sbuild-dofile

- In the repo directory, run `simbabuild`

- This will install it

## BECOME A BETA TESTER!

As CraftServerSetup reaches a milestone one (and thus the 1.0 update), I need some helpers to help me find the last bugs in this program so I can have a nice stable 1.0. To become a beta tester, please send me an email at enderbyte09@gmail.com or message me on discord @enderbyte09. 

As a beta tester, you will need to just use the program, set servers up, screw around, do as much as you want. If you find any bugs, all you need to do is report in the Issues section of this GitHub page or send me an email or Discord.

If you join the Beta Testing program, you will recieve the following rewards:

1. Your name in the credits page of this program

2. A free product key to this software (so you don't have to see any ads)

3. One free infinite advertisement that will be put on the Enderbyte Programs ad network and displayed to all unupgraded CraftServerSetup users

## Product Keys and Ads

As of 0.12.4 this program is semiproprietary. The code remains open source but is commercial in nature. A product key costs $2. If you don't want to get a product key, you will see ads. The ads are approved by me so they are all safe. **If anybody would like to advertise on my ads system, please send me an email at enderbyte09@gmail.com**
